This was my submission for the [Godot Wild Jam 76](https://itch.io/jam/godot-wild-jam-76).
- I've included all the art, sound and code I've used.
- Blender resoruces have not been pushed to git.
- Some resources I have obtained from free sources with credits provided [here](godot_jam_76/Assets/Credits/Credits.gd).

If you'd like you play / view my game, it can be found [here](https://boebi-g.itch.io/godot-jam-76).
